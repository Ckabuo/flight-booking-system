# Flight Booking System

Welcome to the Flight Booking System, a javaScript-focused project designed to manage flight bookings. This system is currently in development, focusing on core functionalities without a graphical user interface (GUI). The project utilizes JavaScript for logic, arrays for data storage, and console interactions for debugging and testing purposes.

## Features

### I. Add Single Day Trips

- **Functionality**: Users can add single-day trips to the system. This involves creating a function that accepts trip details and stores them in an array or object structure.
- **Implementation**: Utilizes JavaScript functions and array methods to handle trip data.

### II. Book Flights

- **Functionality**: Customers can book flights by specifying the source and destination. The system should validate the input and update the booking records accordingly.
- **Implementation**: Uses JavaScript objects and array methods to manage flight bookings.

### III. Cancel Existing Bookings

- **Functionality**: Allows customers to cancel their existing bookings. This requires a function that identifies and removes the booking from the system's records.
- **Implementation**: Leverages JavaScript functions and array/object manipulation techniques to handle cancellations.

### IV. Monitor Itinerary

- **Functionality**: Provides functionality for customers to monitor their itinerary. This could involve retrieving and displaying booking details.
- **Implementation**: Uses JavaScript to interact with stored data and display it to the user through `console.log` statements or simple UI elements.

### V. Filter Flights

- **Functionality**: Enables customers to filter flights based on various criteria such as price, duration, airline, etc.
- **Implementation**: Implements filtering logic using JavaScript functions and array methods.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Flight Booking System, clone the repository and explore the JavaScript files. Familiarize yourself with the functions and data structures used to implement the system's features. Note that this project is currently without a UI, so interactions are primarily through console logs and window prompts.
